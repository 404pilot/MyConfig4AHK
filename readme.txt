Configuration for AutoHotKey

Personal Configuration for easily typing espically during coding time.

Some mappings are the same as KBC Poker keyboard has, which is what I am using right now. Thus it could be convenient for me using these mappings with thinkpad keyboard or poker keyboard.


--------->>>>>>>>> Version 3&4:

fix some bugs

1. # & i : should just be #i (I don't know the reason, under this combination, 3/# is invalid for typing)
2:  use RAlt need Keybd Hook always on
3:  remove LAlt (using RAlt will invalid some built-in keyboard shortcuts, like ctrl+alt+down in eclipse)
